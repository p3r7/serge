#+TITLE: Polymoog Resonator

The original idea to have the filter section of a polymoog extracted as a stand alone effect box was first demonstrated in this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XUiJi5153Y][video by Kenneth Elhardt]].

This inspired J. Haible to make a clone of it as a module.

R*S later released the VC Poly Resonator, which adds VC control over the 3 cutoff frequencies.
