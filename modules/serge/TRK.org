#+TITLE: Touch Responsive Keyboard


* description

  Circuit published by Serge Tcherepnin inside of an issue of Synapse (January/Febuary 1976).

  Supposed to offer similar capabilities to the touch sensors inside of the TKB but with an alternative approach.

  Never made it into an official Serge module but got made into a kit by Ken Stone (CGS86), often integrated into Programmer/Sequencer builds to make a pseudo-TKB.
